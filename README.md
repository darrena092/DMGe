#DMGe
DMGe - A GameBoy emulator and debugger. 

##Current State
Currently it is not 100% functional. We have several opcodes implemented and the basis of a GUI, however both the BIOS and game ROM filenames are hardcoded for test purposes.

There is some graphical output. Currently it will run the BIOS with the correct graphics output, but no sound. Tetris will also boot and run to the main menu.

##Building
Building (as of now) is a *relatively* painless task on both Linux and Windows.

###Prerequisites
DMGe must be built against Boost and wxWidgets. The most recent releases of both will work absolutely fine, although this is subject to change.

###The Build Process
The easiest way to build DMGe is to simply load it up in Code::Blocks, make sure all of the paths are correct and build.
